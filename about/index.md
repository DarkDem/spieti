<h1>SPIE: The HQ</h1>
				
<p> [SPIE](http://spie.org/) is a not-for-profit international professional society for optics and photonics technology, founded in 1955. 
It organizes technical conferences, trade exhibitions, and continuing education programs for researchers and developers in the light-based
fields of physics, including, but not limited to: optics, photonics, and imaging engineering.</p>
 
<p>On July 1, 1955 SPIE was founded as the Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers in California to specialize in the application
of photographic instrumentation. In 1964 the Society formally changed its name to the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers. 
In 1977 SPIE moved its headquarters to Bellingham, Washington, and in 1981, to reflect a changing membership, 
the Society began doing business as (DBA) SPIE—The International Society for Optical Engineering. In 2007, the Society ended its DBA, 
and is referred to simply as SPIE, the International Society for Optics and Photonics.</p> 
 
<P>The society publishes peer-reviewed scientific journals, conference proceedings, monographs, tutorial texts, field guides, 
and reference volumes in print and online. In 2014, the society provided more than $4 million in support of optics education 
and outreach programs around the world. 
 SPIE affiliated student groups are studying optics and photonics at universities around the world.
 SPIE currently has almost three hundred student chapters from more than fifty countries.</P><br/>
 
 <h2> SPIETI: The Techno India Chapter </h2>
 <p>The Techno India SPIE Student Chapter was established in accordance with the SPIE bylaws in October, 2014. 
 This was just three months before the commencement of the United Nations observance of ‘The International Year of Light’.
 The primary objective of the IYL 2015 is to raise global awareness of how optical technologies can promote sustainable development. 
 We, at the Techno India Chapter, in our own little way are striving to raise awareness of how light;
 the essence of our existence can improve the life of mankind in numerous ways.
